CakeCode is a HL language I have developed spesifically for the act of programming games for OLD games consoles.

It was inspired by C and GML.

I thought of the idea for it when I initially began writing emulators. I wanted to develop games for old consoles,
but I didn't really feel like writing out ASM to do it, I wanted a high level language which supported these systems
with out additional libaries.

You will find documentation for the language and a compiler/decomiler for it when I'm comfortable with it's
ability to be used mainstream.
